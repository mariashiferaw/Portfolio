<h2> Synthesis Essay</h2>
<blockquote>
  Everywhere we go, especially in environments where teamwork is highly valued, 
  we hear the phrase leadership. As a nursing major, I understand the need of 
  teamwork in the medical field. Without a leader, there can be no teamwork. 
  Leadership is the ability to inspire everyone on a team by assigning tasks 
  in accordance with workload, assessing each person's abilities, and maintaining
  open lines of communication about areas that need improvement. Several talents
  come into play when we discuss leadership, including motivation, 
  problem-solving, communication, and understanding team members. These are 
  the skills I now want to work on developing. For one team to succeed with 
  any strategy, they must communicate well, be aware of one another's personalities, 
  and depend on the leader to inspire them to find a solution. I view these abilities 
  as fundamental to leadership. These abilities enable a leader to maintain competence, 
  continually communicate any new ideas, and resolve team disputes.

  I place a great importance on the abilities that world leaders possess and the things 
  they have done to make the world a better place. I have made an effort to step outside
   of my comfort zone and attempt new things throughout my time in college and taking on 
   a leadership role is one of those new things. I've had the chance to work in several 
   healthcare settings where I've had to develop and use my leadership skills. I think we 
   have a great responsibility as leaders that must be carried out well. I strive to get to 
   know my team well whenever I have a leadership role and express what is going to be done 
   with the directions. One crucial lesson I took away from this experience is the need of 
   encouraging team members to address any questions they may have to avoid miscommunication 
   or confusion. Another thing to think about is that everyone needs to respect one another 
   because doing so will assist the team avoid disagreements and unhealthy competitiveness. 
   When serving in a leadership capacity, I have observed that there are numerous challenging 
   situations that one may face. In this circumstance, it is necessary to be brave and take
   appropriate action. Although team members may pass judgment, it is the leader's responsibility 
   to make decisions free from the influence of others' viewpoints. Avoiding any personal feelings 
   can help you stay focused on the team's objective. As a senior consultant at MNSU ITS, I also help 
   faculty and students with troubleshooting whenever they encounter technological problems with the 
   educational system. This has tested my ability to provide excellent customer service. My ability to 
   collaborate with my coworkers on various issues and improve my communication skills have both been 
   aided by this position. Since we frequently encounter customers looking for assistance in resolving 
   their problems, this work heavily relies on problem-solving abilities. The most important lesson I 
   took away from this work is to always be confident in the knowledge you possess and to apply it 
   in a way that makes you feel good.

<blockquote>
I will always be open-minded for the leadership experiences I will have in the future, particularly 
in the healthcare setting. As a nurse, I want to work in a position where we can save many lives and 
deliver excellent care. Building relationships with the people I work with is something I still want 
to improve on. When a team and the leader have a good working connection, they work harder because 
they don't want to lose the leader's trust. My ability to communicate with the team and other 
employees will also improve as a result of this.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
In general, leadership is a position surrounded by a variety of talents that aids a team, 
association, nation, and other groups in achieving their objectives in accordance with the 
plan. One can develop skills that are useful in various roles when seeking to learn about 
leadership. Additionally, it is something that develops over time and with practice. It 
necessitates having an open mind to different viewpoints. In the career I'm pursuing, I will 
constantly look forward to honing my leadership abilities.
