  <blockquote>
    From my understanding the competency area of Research, Scholarly, and Creative Activity is a logic-based 
    approach that can foster critical thinking, creativity, and the capacity to locate reliable resources to 
    address the issue at hand. To accomplish a research's objective, numerous steps and processes must be taken. 
    I'll practice my critical thinking, problem-solving, ability to locate trustworthy sources, information 
    gathering techniques, and research methods in this section of the lesson. Given that the healthcare industry 
    is one of the many industries that is growing and evolving rapidly, I think these abilities are crucial for me 
    as a nursing student. Regarding patient care and equipment use, there are several areas in healthcare that require 
    improvement. I want to raise awareness of these problems, but to accomplish that, I need to perform some study. 
    It is a technique for dealing with a professional issue that enables other healthcare professionals and patients 
    to offer more information via surveys, questionnaires, and other techniques.

  Currently I am doing research along with my faculty on the topic of autism and how it affects the family 
  dynamics which has given me a good understanding on how research can be conducted. I have learned how 
  originality helps come up with great ideas for research. For example, in my case since the idea of doing 
  research on this topic came from my end, I knew what exactly I wanted so I created the questions according 
  to my interest. After that what I learned is that digging into information on the topic which seems is easy, 
  but it is difficult. When gathering information, it must be related to the topic it has to be accurate and 
  content that give us an understanding of the problem. As we all know there are many resources out there but 
  what we do not know is which one is a reliable information. This topic was also raised in class, and we had 
  the chance to work on it which added to my skills. Even though I have been doing that for a while it still 
  can be difficult for me to find credible sources that help guide my topic. Another thing I have been working 
  is my critical skill which helps come up with great ideas for my research and how to apply. One idea that I 
  had and was able to accomplish when beginning this research was working with autistic individuals in a home 
  care setting. Working closely with these patients has helped understand their conditions and behaviors along
  with their family diagnosis.

  I am a nursing student, and my objective has always been to raise the standard of patient care in all healthcare 
  settings, therefore these experiences are relevant for me. The abilities I currently possess and will develop in 
  the future will enable me to support the promotion of the highest caliber of treatment and patient satisfaction. 
  Research is utilized in a wide variety of fields, not just nursing, to educate the public and raise awareness of 
  various issues. Another way that this experience has helped me grow is through honing my problem-solving abilities. 
  Research challenges people's thinking, allowing them to come up with new solutions to the same problems.

    <blockquote>
    For the future I would like to work on applying the skills that I already have so that I can get better at it. 
    In my opinion just having skills does not help unless we apply to make change in this world so that it can 
    impact the people positively. As a healthcare worker if I can identify a solution for a problem but do not share 
    it what good is in it. I must create awareness on the issue and provide the solution so that there is improved 
    patient care. The more we practice our skill the more we get expert on that area. I believe it can help create 
    a better environment where patients are satisfied with the care provided for them.
    </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>
    In conclusion, the competency areas of research, scholarly, creativity activity has helped me understand the core points 
    in research that should taken into consideration. The fact that we got the chance to learn about credible sources with 
    the librarian has improved my searching techniques to track down reliable information. Understanding that there is many 
    false information out in the media it is essential to know how to narrow down our topic and find the accurate ones. I want to 
    keep on working on skills my skills so that I can be able to promote high quality health care.
