    <h1> Intercultural Engagement</h1>

 </section> 

  <blockquote>
    I primarily considered how I would further my nursing career's goals when determining whether to study abroad. 
    I never really gave it much thought, but I knew the moment I decided to relocate here that I would lead a very 
    different lifestyle. It was difficult to leave my hometown and upbringing, with its diverse culture and social mores.
     A new chapter in my life began when I made the decision to leave the country where I had lived for the previous 18 years. 
     I promised myself that I would be open-minded about any opportunities that might come my way.

  <blockquote>
    I have been more aware of how far I have gone with my intercultural engagement abilities as a result of being enrolled 
    in the honors course, especially as an international student. The three competency areas of leadership, research, and 
    intercultural engagement are included in the objectives of the honors course. I believe that the leadership position 
    prepares students to take on various leadership roles and responsibilities and to do so successfully. The students' 
    confidence is boosted, enabling them to move more quickly toward their objective. On the other hand, research aids 
    students in gathering information and working to produce resources that are beneficial to the globe. Intercultural 
    engagement is a broad subject that students can discuss and exchange opinions about their cultural backgrounds. 
    In this subject, I want to concentrate on developing my ability to take on difficult responsibilities and positively 
    influence the workplace environment, particularly as a nursing student.

  Even participating in various volunteer activities and being able to communicate my ideas for a good cause. 
  As a college student, I want to be sure to take advantage of any chance I must understand my potential. 
  These abilities could offer me the assurance I need to impart my knowledge and help others. It will aid me 
  in my professional endeavors in persuading clients to feel secure and able to rely on me. My friends and the 
  community can benefit from my ability to socialize and communicate about my culture.

    For some personal circumstances, I was unable to come before orientation and instead arrived one week into the semester, 
    which exacerbated everything. The goal of orientation week is to acquaint students with the school and provide them with 
    opportunities to interact with one another so they can form friendships. Since my situation did not turn out as I had hoped, 
    I was both perplexed and under stress. Everything was novel, including the language used, the way people learned, ate, 
    celebrated, and communicated. I read books and watched a lot of Hollywood movies when I was growing up, but I was still 
    unfamiliar with them. Since I was usually too nervous to even speak out in class, I would simply listen to the lecture and 
    leave. In addition to my major class on the first semester, I also took first-year seminar and public speaking, for which 
    I am still grateful. Those lectures helped me realize that I was not the only one experiencing difficulties because of culture 
    shock. They found it difficult to interact with others and felt like outsiders in this place. We had to give presentations and 
    participate in group discussions, so I got the chance to meet and talk to international students about my experiences. I used 
    to dislike giving presentations, especially when it came to public speaking, but I eventually realized that it was helping 
    me gain confidence.

    <blockquote>
      Even for my other courses, I started to participate in class and ask questions as I began to like it. I was participating 
      in a study group with my buddies the next thing I knew. As I started to get used to the way of life, COVID struck, and 
      things got stressful because no one was getting together, and everyone was feeling lonely at home. With the support of 
      the skills I learned, I was able to connect with my friends on social media to share crucial information about the 
      epidemic and continue our study. Even though I arrived in a challenging situation, it has helped me improve my communication 
      and socialization skills with people from other cultural backgrounds. Coming from a multicultural country, I had a lot to 
      share, so I cooked my traditional dish for curious onlookers. We once held cultural nights where we displayed our eating, 
      dancing, and other customs. One of the ways we used to introduce ourselves to others was through this. Today, I am aware 
      of who I am and what it means to me, and I am also capable of teaching others with respect.

      I am aware that I have a long way to go and that this is only the beginning; even though they may be difficult, 
      many possibilities are in store for me. Everyone has the capacity to learn and make a difference in the world. 
      My ability to communicate and learn to accept the differences between me and the rest of the world still needs 
      improvement. To provide my patients with compassionate and understanding treatment, it is crucial that I have 
      effective communication skills. I also want to work on being more personable because many people think I have a 
      serious and unpleasant nature. Once they are familiar with me, they make sure to let me know that I need to 
      modify my strategy. I have been working on it ever since I arrived here, but it has not been simple. For me, 
      it is essential that I have a friendly demeanor so that my patients can communicate their anxiety.

    <blockquote>
      In conclusion, I am at a loss for words to describe what I have gone through and how it has affected my life, 
      but it completely altered my way of life and thinking. It was uncomfortable and challenging for me to accept 
      at the time, but here I am writing about my experience and how it challenged. There is always a reward for 
      overcoming adversity, and mine is the life experience I was able to gather. To prevent the newcomers from 
      thinking they cannot manage it, I share my experience with them whenever I get the chance. I will continue 
      honing my skills for better results.
