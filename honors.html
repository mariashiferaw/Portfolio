    <h2> Why honors?</h2>
    <blockquote>
        Everyone has their own positive traits and life achievements,
        but not everyone is aware of how to showcase their best attributes. 
        Prior to my sophomore year at MNSU, I was unaware of the honors program. 
        My friend came over at that point and told me about the advantages of taking the class. 
        I then made the decision to apply for the program. I was turned down. 
        I reapplied for the next semester because I was so excited to attend the course, 
        and this time I got accepted.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        My honors advisor's advice helped me better comprehend the purpose of the entire program 
        and how I may advance my career. Even though I have been involved in a variety of activities, 
        events, leadership roles, and research projects, I was unsure of how to continue building on my
        current successes. We are going to develop our portfolios, which helps me develop while also learning 
        more about myself. By allowing me time to work on the things I need to, it can help me identify my strengths 
        and flaws. I want to be able to use these attributes, whether in class or at events, to increase the impact 
        of my contribution once I have a solid grasp of how I may develop my mission, values, and competences. 
        I'll attempt to make the most of my college experience using the information I've learned. 
        I wish to graduate with honors and go on to actively participate in activities that benefit society 
        and present oneself with confidence. In addition, I want to be open to improvement and aware of my 
        weaknesses. Being fiercely competitive when giving treatment and assistance for my patients will help 
        me in my future profession. Having those excellent characteristics, I can assist my patients in doing 
        their best. I have been practicing professional communication and teamwork throughout my undergraduate
        experience; therefore, I am able to work with my team in a professional manner.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Overall, I think this is a great chance for me to grow personally based on my prior experience and 
        comprehend what it means for me. It will enable me to interact more effectively and positively 
        with my classmates, neighborhood, family, and other people. I'll do my best to take advantage 
        of every chance I get in college to advance and direct myself. I'm excited about all the opportunities,
        experiences, and events that will come my way so that I can make a significant life change.
